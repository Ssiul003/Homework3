/*The program should basically run if the program can scan
an input file with a number on each line. As long as it's not a negative number
it should run. The program should also have an output file named output.txt
because the print statements are printing to the file instead of the 
System.out. The assignment was done by using previous methods done in 
my other CISC 1115 class and combining it by using the while statements
to repeat until there is no more numbers.
