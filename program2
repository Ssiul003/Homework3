/*The program should run if the prompts are followed. I believe it's pretty basic
because it has two options between rectangle or circle. I could've added a square and 
include the or operator because rectangle and squares are similar. In my if statement
I originally had shape==rectangle but that wouldn't run my if statements. However, I
remember the string method .equals from my previous CISC 1115 class and it ran the 
if statements completely.
